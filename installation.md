# Installation guide

## Hardware
First of all, order PCB from any PCB service you like. I used JLCPCB, their default settings worked fine.

After you get the PCBs, solder in all parts. A couple of reccomendations:

ALWAYS use flux. There will never be too much of it. 

Leave nixie tubes for the end. First solder everything else, and write the firmware. Then insert each tube individually, and turn the clock on without soldering them in to test.
