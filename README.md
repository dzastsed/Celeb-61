# Firmware

Regular clock, and clock with scrambling code implemented are included in this repo.

*note - firmware may still change*

# Known issues

Tube footprint has 0 and dot pins mixed up, so current design needs 4 trace cuts and 4 bodge wires to fix this.

USB-PD module does not perfectly screw in.

There is a better RTC module, which footprint will be added in new revision.
